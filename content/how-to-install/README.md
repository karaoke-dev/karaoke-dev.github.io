# How to install

## All install ways

If you are linux or osx user, you can copy `.dll` from [release page](https://github.com/karaoke-dev/karaoke/releases) like [other ruleset do](https://github.com/LumpBloom7/sentakki/wiki/Ruleset-installation-guide).

But if you are windows user, i recommend you use [Osu-ModeManager](https://github.com/starflash-studios/Osu-ModeManager) to `get`/`update` ruleset.

.

## Osu-ModeManager

1. If you are trying to use [Osu-ModeManager](https://github.com/starflash-studios/Osu-ModeManager/releases), download latest ruleset from [release page](https://github.com/starflash-studios/Osu-ModeManager/releases).

2. Download sample ruleset list from [here](res/osu.Game.Rulesets.List.txt), so you don't need to add it manually.

3. Open this program and login with your github account.

8. You can add another ruleset by yourself, but be careful url should be end of `/`, like : https://github.com/karaoke-dev/karaoke`/`

## Notice

- Remember re-update ruleset if new lazer client has been updated.
- If placing some ruleset's `.dll` in `%AppData%/osu!/rulesets` before, please remove them first.
